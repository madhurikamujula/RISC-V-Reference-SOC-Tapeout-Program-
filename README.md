🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — VSD
    🇮🇳 RISC-V VSD Participants – India

"My adventure in the SoC Tapeout Program VSD begins here."
This repository records my week-by-week progress as I complete tasks and learn new skills.

### 📚 About The Program
 
🚀 In this program, we explore the complete journey of designing a System-on-Chip (SoC) — from RTL to GDSII — using open-source tools. As part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, this program empowers 3500+ participants to create real silicon and contribute to strengthening the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

 ### 📅 *Week 0* → [Tools installation](week0/README.md)
 
    Task 0 - 🛠️Tools Installation
     * Installed Icarus Verilog(iverilog) for verilog simulation
     * Installed Yosys for RTL synthesis
     * Installed gtkwave for waveform viewing and debugging
     ✅Status: Completed Successfully
     
### 🌟 What I Learned in Week 0:

✅ Successfully installed & verified open-source EDA tools

⚙ Understood the basic environment setup for RTL design & synthesis

🚀 Prepared the system for the upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments

### 🙏 Thanks & Acknowledgment

I sincerely thank Kunal Ghosh and the VLSI System Design (VSD) team for providing me the opportunity to participate in the ongoing RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I would also like to acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless, whose efforts have made this initiative possible.
